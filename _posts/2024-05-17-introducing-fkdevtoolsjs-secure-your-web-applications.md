title: Introducing F--kDevTools.js: Secure Your Web Applications
---


In the world of web development, security is paramount. We created F**kDevTools.js to address a common vulnerability: the exposure of sensitive information through browser developer tools. By disabling these tools, we aim to enhance the security of web applications and protect against potential attacks and data breaches.

## How It Helps Developers

F**kDevTools.js provides a straightforward solution for developers to prevent unauthorized access to their site's backend through browser developer tools. By disabling right-click, F12, and Ctrl+Shift+I shortcuts, this script minimizes the risk of users inspecting or tampering with the site's code. This added layer of security is especially beneficial for applications dealing with sensitive data.

## Installation

Integrating F**kDevTools.js into your project is simple. Follow these steps:

1. **Include the Script**: Add the following script to your HTML file:
   ```html
   <script src="path/to/FuckDevTools.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Configuration**: Customize the configuration options as needed:
   ```javascript
   var disable_right_click = true;
   var disable_f12 = true;
   var disable_csi = true;
   document.onkeydown = function(event) {
       if (disable_f12) {
           if (event.keyCode == 123) {
               event.preventDefault();
           }
       }
       if (disable_csi) {
           if (event.ctrlKey && event.shiftKey && event.keyCode == 73) {
               event.preventDefault();
           }
       }
   }
   if (disable_right_click) {
       document.oncontextmenu = function() {
           event.preventDefault();
       }
   }
   ```
